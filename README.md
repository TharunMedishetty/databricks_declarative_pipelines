# Data Warehousing with Databricks DLT

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
Welcome to the **DLT Project** repository! ðŸš€

This project demonstrates how to build a Data Warehouse using Databricks Declarative Live Tables (DLT) pipelines. It showcases key DLT features such as:

- Flows for orchestration
- Streaming tables for incremental data processing
 -Materialized views for optimized query performance
 -Views for transformations and logic abstraction
 -Change Data Capture (CDC) and Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Types 1 & 2)

The project also applies the Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold layers) to design a structured DWH pipeline.

In addition, detailed step-by-step documentation is provided with screenshots, making it easy to follow and understand the design, implementation, and execution of each stage.
